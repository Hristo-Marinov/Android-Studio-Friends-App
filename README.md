Straightforward application with basic list manipulation and user interaction capabilities, ideal for scenarios where simple data handling and navigation are required. activity_second Layout: Features an ImageView for a profile picture, a TextView for a user name or title, three buttons ("Add", "Remove", "Logout"), and a ListView for dynamically displaying and manipulating a list of items.

SecondActivity Activity: Handles user interactions with the buttons to add or remove items from the ListView and navigates back to the first activity upon clicking the "Logout" button. MainActivity Activity: This code can log in with predefined credentials, and successful login navigates to SecondActivity, while incorrect credentials prompt a toast message. activity_main Layout: This XML layout defines a vertical LinearLayout for MainActivity containing two EditText fields for email and password input, and a "Login" button.
